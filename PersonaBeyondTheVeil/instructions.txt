Using the custom sheet on Roll20.

1) You need to have a Pro account in order to use custom sheets;
2) In the Game Settings, on the Character Sheet Template dropdown, select Custom;
3) Below that, 4 tabs will open: HTML Layout, CSS Styling, Translation and Preview;
4) Open the persona.html file in any text editor, copy it's contents and paste it on the HTML Layout tab;
5) Repeat that copying the content from the persona.css file to the CSS Styling tab;
6) Now, doing the same, copy the content from the translation.json file to the Translation tab;
7) Click on Save Changes and you are done.

PS: The sheet uses the Border.svg file that is in the assets folder to render the sheet's black borders. But the image it is pointing to is
actually on my github repository. I won't delete it, but if the border somehow stops loading, it's because something happened to my repo.
To fix that, juts store this image on any server (like imgur, for instance) and change the URL for the border-image-source on this
part of the persona.css file:

.sheet-black-full-border {
	border: 12px solid black;
	border-image-source: url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielsousat/Roll20CustomSheets/5191fe48acafe88230d2dc9980133ab6235a1a91/PersonaBeyondTheVeil/assets/Border.svg');
	border-image-slice: 10;
	border-image-width: 1;
	border-image-outset: initial;
	border-image-repeat: stretch;
}

.sheet-black-top-left-border {
	border-left: 12px solid black;
	border-top: 12px solid black;
	border-image-source: url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielsousat/Roll20CustomSheets/5191fe48acafe88230d2dc9980133ab6235a1a91/PersonaBeyondTheVeil/assets/Border.svg');
	border-image-slice: 10;
	border-image-width: 1;
	border-image-outset: initial;
	border-image-repeat: stretch;
}
